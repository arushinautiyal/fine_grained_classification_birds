# fine_grained_classification_birds

This work uses  CUB-200-2011 dataset, leveraging deep learning model (transfer learning model called Xception) in order to classify 200 species of birds. The dataset is split between training and testing using the provided train_test_split.txt file, where 1 denotes training data and 0 denotes test data and the image ID is extracted from the image.txt file. This model was able to predict the bird classification with 72% accuracy.
